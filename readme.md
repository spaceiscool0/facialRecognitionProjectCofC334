This is a class project for the CSCI 334- Data Mining with College of Charleston. It was completed Spring 2022 by Jaxson Lyles and Hai Nguyen. 

This project is a deep learning application  used to detect whether or not an image containing a person’s face is negative or positive. It’s made using common tools such as Tensorflow, OpenCV, and Jupyter Notebook. The dataset used is  the FER 2013 dataset. We hope to implement the technology in place as well as the knowledge learned from an existing model to via transfer learning  create a functioning real time facial emotion recognition application. 

To run the project, you will have to change the data paths so that they line up with the training and testing files
